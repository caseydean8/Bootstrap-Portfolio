# Bootstrap-Portfoli0
This is a bootstrap rendition of my first html/css page. The responsive nav bar was challenging but I like how it turned out. The carousel effect in the portfolio page is cool, but it was basically a copy-paste. I understand why bootstrap could be very advantageous in certain scenarios, a developer with a good working knowledge of it could construct a professional looking site very quickly.
